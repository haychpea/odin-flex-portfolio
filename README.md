# Odin Flexbox Project
This is my take on the landing page project for the Flexbox section in the Foundations of The Odin Project. Details found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

## Reflection on project ##
This project has shown me how key flexbox is to developing a responsive web experience, without it, webpages would just be a boring text document without the ability to adapt to different browser sizes.

I will take the knowledge developed from this project and supporting material into consideration for any future websites I create.

## Things I would change ##
There are a couple of things that I would change in the future, mainly because I havent learnt how to do certain things yet with a page.

One example of something I would change is the call to action box. The text inside of which doesnt flex correctly when used on a portrait screen like on a mobile device. In this instance I would use a small bit of JavaScript to remove the secondary text when the browser window goes below a certain width.

I would also use images with a more optimised resolution, as the ones currently used are high resolution and take a bit of time to load into the page. This could easily be done by including some resized pictures in a separate folder of the site.
